## R Libraries
`class`: functions for classification, including k-nearest neighbor, learning vector quantization, and self-organizing maps

`gmodels`: programming tools for model fitting.

`tm`: framework for text mining applications.

`SnowballC`: interface to the C libstemmer library that implements Porter's word stemming algorithm for collapsing words to a common root to aid comparison of vocabulary.

`e071`: functions for latent class analysis, short time Fourier transform, fuzzy clustering, support vector machines, shortest path computation, bagged cluster, and naive Bayes. Whew!

`klaR`: classification and visualization functions.

`C50`: C5.0 decision trees and rule-based models for pattern recognition.

`RWeka`: machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks, written in Java. Supports pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.

`psych`: graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis, and structural equation models.

`caret`: set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models.
